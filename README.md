# **Event Based Analysis**

## **Project Summary**

This project analyzes user behavior in a food delivery app through funnel analysis and an A/A/B test. The funnel study identifies where users drop off before completing a purchase, while the experiment evaluates whether changing the app’s font design impacts conversion rates. The results provide actionable insights to improve both user experience and business performance.

## **Tools & Libraries**

- Pandas – data cleaning, wrangling, and aggregation
- NumPy – numerical operations and array handling
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization and funnel plots
- SciPy / Statsmodels – statistical testing for A/A/B experiments
